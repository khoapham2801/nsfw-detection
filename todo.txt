    1. Deploy Jenkins on GCE.
    2. Link Jenkins to github + add webhook to listen for changes in repo.

    NOTEs: DinD, DooD when running docker inside Jenkins container.
    
24/09/2024:
    1. Open port 8000 to test Jenkins deployed nsfw-det-app API. --> Abort.
    2. Force Jenkins to deploy app on GKE instead of GCE. --> Use Helm.
    3. Problem when depolying again when an existed app is already up (port duplication). --> Delay (after using Helm)

25/09/2024:
    1. Apply Helm for deployment.
    2. Test with Helm.
    NOTEs: 
        - Node autoscale (upper boundary).
        - In Jenkins deploy stage that uses k8s agent with Helm, J will pull the desired image and create a container
        from such image that had helm already installed. J will also mount our workspace to the created container.

26/09/2024:
    1. Learn: Observable Systems.
